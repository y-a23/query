The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities.","A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as \"review for abnormality\" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation.","The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (≥AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up."],"labels":["BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS"],"meshes":["Adenocarcinoma","Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Female","Humans","Mass Screening","Middle Aged","Papanicolaou Test","Sensitivity and Specificity","Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","Vaginal Smears","Young Adult"],"reasoning_free_pred":["y","e","s"],"reasoning_required_pred":["y","e","s"]},"final_decision":"yes","pubid":26348845,"long_answer":"Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% (at the AGC threshold).
